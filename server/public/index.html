            About Me
          </h3>
          <p>
            Full-Stack Software Engineer experienced with Javascript technologies. Has experience and is skilled in
            creating back-end servers with Node, Express, Koa with MongoDB databases. For the front-end, I am familiar
            with both React and Angular, using TypeScript for all of my projects. I am interested in Apollo GraphQL and
            Machine Learning.

          <p>
            Communication has always been my strong point and I am able to effectively work in any kind of team, either
            by managing and scheduling other people or by finishing my assigned work in a timely manner. I am also quick
            on the uptake and require little supervision before getting accustomed to new environments. Adapting to new
            technologies is always a joy and pleasure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Healthy body, healthy mind is something I try to live by and so I do my best to cook and workout daily. As a
            mathematician gone rogue, I still keep up with the latest news and advances in Math and Physics. I look
            forward to the day I can wipe out while gaming in VR.
